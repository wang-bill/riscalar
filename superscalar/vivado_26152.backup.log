INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [C:/Users/Catherine Tang/Desktop/62050/riscalar/superscalar/xdc/top_level.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/top_level_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/top_level_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

CRITICAL WARNING: [DRC LUTLP-1] Combinatorial Loop Alert: 2 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is data_mem/data_mem/counter_reg[0]. Please evaluate your design. The cells in the loop are: data_mem/data_mem/head[0]_i_4, and reorder_buffer/old_store_read_i_1.

Running DRC as a precondition to command route_design
INFO: [DRC 23-27] Running DRC with 2 threads
CRITICAL WARNING: [DRC LUTLP-1] Combinatorial Loop Alert: 2 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is data_mem/data_mem/counter_reg[0]. Please evaluate your design. The cells in the loop are: data_mem/data_mem/head[0]_i_4, and reorder_buffer/old_store_read_i_1.
