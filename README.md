### RISC-V Superscalar Processor

TODO:
 - Cross-module test cases
 - Memory access
 - Superscalar

November 10th: Finish single-cycle and pipelined processor, start implementing superscalar
November 17th: Finish superscalar
November 24th: Implement Branch Prediction + Speculative Execution; Finish setting up read/write to SD Card
December 1st: SD Card Flashing + Caches
December 8th: Benchmarking, Begin writing final report (Â½ done)
December 12th (Due December 14th): Finish final report

Next Steps (Catherine):
Integrate the instruction memory into the processor (how should we load the memory with instructions?)\n

Pipeline the processor (I anticipate this will be more of a challenge than we expect logistically); we might need to add depth to the registers for the pc for example to calculate on multiple pc values at a time...?\n

Questions:
How do we handle branches?\n
ALU as a functional unit?\n
